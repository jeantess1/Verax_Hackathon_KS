# Verax_Hackathon_KS
Verax is a blockchain project on the BOS (Near) platform, created during the KRYPTOSPHERE hackathon. Its aim is to provide a decentralized platform for the disclosure of confidential documents, protecting the identities of whistleblowers while ensuring transparency. 

Users can create their own Alerts, that will appear as a feed on our site. Their alert will be an NFT linked to their wallet. The site has two pages, a feed page that displays all the alerts, and a minting page that allows the creation of the alerts.7

The code of the contract is provided in this repo, and the frontend of the site is fully deployed on BOS, by the user ```dd1e4dc79092f25987af6d882fe6a33acca7d672245e13e99243c17745d08fa0```.

Our solution is live. To use it, you can simply connect to ```https://near.social/embed/dd1e4dc79092f25987af6d882fe6a33acca7d672245e13e99243c17745d08fa0/widget/Verax``` to connect to the landing page, where all our alerts are displayed.

If you want to publish your own alerts, you can do it on this page ```https://near.social/embed/dd1e4dc79092f25987af6d882fe6a33acca7d672245e13e99243c17745d08fa0/widget/mintpage```. You can enter your address, the title of your post, a text and an image, and it will mint to your address the NFT associated to your post, before displaying it in the feed of all the posts.

!! Important !! The minting contract is deployed on the Goerli TestNet, so in order to mint your post, you will need Goerli to pay for the gas fees.
